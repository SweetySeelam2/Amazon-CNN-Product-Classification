## 📂 Project Overview

| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 **Model**               | CNN (Conv2D + MaxPooling + Dropout + Dense Layers)                         |
| 🧠 **Explainability**      | LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)                     |
| 🧾 **Use Case**            | Explainable image classification for product catalogs                      |
| 🌐 **Interface**           | Streamlit app to upload images and view prediction + heatmap explanation   |

## 💼 Business Problem

Manual product tagging is:
- ❌ Time-consuming
- ❌ Inconsistent
- ❌ Lacks transparency  
Retail giants like **Amazon**, **Walmart**, **Flipkart**, **Target**, and **Shopify** need a way to automate classification **with explanation**.

---

## ✅ Solution: This Project

This app allows non-technical users (e.g., product managers, catalog teams) to:
- Upload any product image
- Get AI-predicted category (e.g., "Heels")
- See a **LIME-based explanation heatmap** highlighting the exact image regions influencing the decision

## 💰 Business Impact

| Metric                          | Value Estimate                      |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 💲 Manual Tagging Cost           | ~$1.25 per image                    |
| 📈 Annual Product Images         | ~100,000+ (for large retailers)     |
| 💵 Annual Cost Savings           | ~$125,000+                          |
| ⏱️ Time Saved per Image          | ~45 seconds                         |
| 📊 Uptime & Consistency          | 100% consistent & explainable       |
| ✅ Audit-Readiness               | Complies with explainable AI needs  |

## 🧪 Model Results & Interpretation

- ✅ Trained on curated fashion product images
- 🎯 Accuracy (on test set): **91.6%**
- 🔍 Confidence score (example prediction): **95.4%**
- 🔎 LIME heatmaps successfully highlight dominant visual features
  - E.g., shoe sole, heel, or neckline

## 🧠 Conclusion

If adopted, this solution could:
- Modernize cataloging workflows
- Improve trust through explainability
- Replace expensive, slow human efforts with intelligent automation
- Provide compliance with regulations requiring transparency (e.g., EU AI Act)

---

## 🧾 Business Recommendations

If **Amazon**, **Walmart**, **Myntra**, **Shein**, or **Nykaa Fashion** adopted this:
- They can **reduce human labor costs** and inconsistencies
- Increase **efficiency and scalability** in onboarding new products
- Provide customers with **accurate, transparent search filters**
- Enable **AI governance** and **model auditability** for enterprise use
