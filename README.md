## 💼 Business Problem

Manual product tagging is:
- ❌ Time-consuming
- ❌ Inconsistent
- ❌ Lacks transparency

Retail giants like **Amazon**, **Walmart**, **Flipkart**, **Target**, and **Shopify** need to automate classification **with explanation**.

---

## ✅ Solution: This Project

This app allows non-technical users (e.g., product managers, catalog teams) to:
- Select a real product sample image
- Instantly get the AI-predicted category (e.g., "Handbags")
- See a **LIME-based explanation heatmap** highlighting the exact image regions influencing the decision

## 📦 CNN Baseline Model – Summary & Performance

### 📌 Model & Training Configuration

- **Model Type:** Sequential CNN  
- **Architecture:** Conv2D → MaxPooling → Dropout → Dense  
- **Objective:** 5-class classification of Amazon fashion product images  
- **Input:** RGB images, 224×224×3  
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy  
- **Batch Size:** 32  
- **Epochs:** 20  
- **Callbacks:** EarlyStopping (patience=3), ReduceLROnPlateau (patience=2, factor=0.2)  

### 📊 Model Performance

- Accuracy improved from 49.92% (Epoch 1) to 81.68% (train, Epoch 16) and peaked at 85.47% (val, Epoch 15).
- Loss decreased from 2.05 (train, Epoch 1) to 0.5660 (train, Epoch 16), and 1.07 (val, Epoch 1) to 0.5117 (val, Epoch 16).
- Minimal overfitting: validation accuracy closely tracked training accuracy.
- All model checkpoints and metadata files are included in this repository.

**Note:**  
We also tested transfer learning models (ResNet50, EfficientNetB0), but in this scenario, the custom CNN baseline consistently outperformed them in both accuracy and reliability. This makes it the optimal solution for this dataset and business use case.

## 💰 Business Impact

| Metric                          | Value Estimate                      |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 💲 Manual Tagging Cost           | ~$1.25 per image                    |
| 📈 Annual Product Images         | ~100,000+ (for large retailers)     |
| 💵 Annual Cost Savings           | ~$125,000+                          |
| ⏱️ Time Saved per Image          | ~60% onboarding time                |
| 📊 Consistency                   | 100% auditable and explainable      |
| ✅ Audit-Readiness               | Complies with explainable AI needs  |

- If integrated, this system can deliver **85.20%+ classification accuracy** on real-world product images.
- Eliminates manual tagging, saving ~$1.25 per product.
- At 100,000 uploads/year: ~$125,000 saved, ~60% faster onboarding, 20–25% fewer errors.
- LIME explanations ensure transparency, auditability, and compliance (e.g., EU AI Act).

## 🧠 Conclusion

- The custom CNN Baseline Model achieves **peak validation accuracy of 85.47%** (Epoch 15) and **final validation accuracy of 85.20%** (Epoch 16) on unseen Amazon product images (holdout set).
- This strong result shows that even a carefully designed CNN—**without transfer learning**—delivers robust, reliable performance for large-scale e-commerce product classification.
- LIME visual explanations make every prediction **auditable and trustworthy**, connecting AI automation with human decision-makers.
- **Why this model?**  
  Experiments with ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 did **not outperform** this CNN baseline. This validates the custom model as the best professional baseline for your app and use case.

## 🧾 Business Recommendations

If **Amazon**, **Walmart**, **Myntra**, **Shein**, **Flipkart**, or **Shopify** adopted this:
- **Reduce manual labor costs** and inconsistencies
- **Increase efficiency and scalability** in onboarding new products
- Provide customers with **accurate, transparent search filters**
- Enable **AI governance** and **model auditability** for enterprise use

For future scaling:  
The app can be upgraded to larger or deeper models as data volume and diversity increase, but for this dataset, the CNN baseline is optimal.

## 📚 Project Storytelling

Imagine an e-commerce giant launching thousands of new products every week. Traditionally, each item is manually tagged by human agents—slow, inconsistent, and costly.

**In this project:**
- We built a custom CNN model trained on tens of thousands of labeled images to classify products like "Sneaker", "Shirt", or "Handbag".
- We implemented LIME to provide **visual, user-friendly explanations** for every prediction.

**The result:**  
A reliable AI solution that doesn’t just predict—it **justifies** itself.

- For each sample image:
    - Predicts the product class with **85%+ accuracy**
    - Shows confidence for transparency
    - Generates a LIME heatmap of model focus

**Outcome:**  
This project demonstrates how **AI + explainability** can save $100,000+ per year, eliminate human bottlenecks, and make every model decision auditable for business and compliance.  
It's about more than pixels—it's about trust, automation, and the future of e-commerce.
